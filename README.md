# multipleLinearRegression-BrooklynHomePrices
I created a multiple linear regression model that predicted the price of a Brooklyn home by analyzing different potential predictor variables. After, I analyzed the shift in Brooklyn home prices in 2020 from Quarter 3 (Q3) and Quarter 4 (Q4) with the created predictor model. Do not duplicate.
